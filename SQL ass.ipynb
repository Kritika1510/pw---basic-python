    "Q1.  \n",
    "   - A database is a structured collection of data that is organized and stored electronically. It allows for efficient retrieval, insertion, and manipulation of data.\n",
    "   - SQL (Structured Query Language) databases are relational databases that use structured query language to define and manipulate the data. They organize data into tables, which have predefined schemas.\n",
    "   - NoSQL databases, on the other hand, are non-relational databases that do not require a fixed schema. They are more flexible and can handle unstructured data. NoSQL databases use different data models such as key-value pairs, document stores, column-oriented, or graph databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. \n",
    "   - DDL (Data Definition Language) is a subset of SQL used to define and modify the structure of database objects.\n",
    "   - **CREATE** is used to create new database objects like tables, indexes, or views.\n",
    "   - **DROP** is used to delete existing database objects.\n",
    "   - **ALTER** is used to modify the structure of existing database objects.\n",
    "   - **TRUNCATE** is used to remove all records from a table without removing the table structure.\n",
    "   Example: \n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   CREATE TABLE employees (\n",
    "       id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "       name VARCHAR(50),\n",
    "       age INT\n",
    "   );\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. \n",
    "   - DML (Data Manipulation Language) is used to manipulate data within database objects.\n",
    "   - **INSERT** is used to add new records to a table.\n",
    "   - **UPDATE** is used to modify existing records in a table.\n",
    "   - **DELETE** is used to remove existing records from a table.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   INSERT INTO employees (id, name, age) VALUES (1, 'John', 30);\n",
    "   UPDATE employees SET age = 31 WHERE name = 'John';\n",
    "   DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = 'John';\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. **What is DQL? Explain SELECT with an example:**\n",
    "   - DQL (Data Query Language) is used to retrieve data from the database.\n",
    "   - **SELECT** statement is used to retrieve data from one or more tables.\n",
    "   Example:\n",
    "   ```sql\n",
    "   SELECT * FROM employees WHERE age > 30;\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. \n",
    "   - **Primary Key**: A primary key is a column or a set of columns that uniquely identifies each row in a table. It ensures that each row in a table is unique and not null. Only one primary key can be defined for a table.\n",
    "   - **Foreign Key**: A foreign key is a column or a set of columns in one table that references the primary key columns in another table. It establishes a link between the two tables, enforcing referential integrity.\n",

    "   import mysql.connector\n",

    "   mydb = mysql.connector.connect(\n",

    "       user=\"yourusername\",\n",
    "       password=\"yourpassword\",\n",

    "   # Create cursor object\n",
    "   mycursor = mydb.cursor()\n",

    "   mycursor.execute(\"SELECT * FROM employees\")\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Fetch results\n",
    "   for row in mycursor.fetchall():\n",
    "       print(row)\n",
    "\n",
    "   # Close connection\n",
    "   mydb.close()\n",
    "   ```\n",
    "   - **cursor()**: The cursor() method creates a cursor object which is used to execute SQL queries and fetch results from the database.\n",
    "   - **execute()**: The execute() method is used to execute SQL queries. It takes an SQL query as a parameter and executes it on the database.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q7. \n",
    "   - 1. **FROM**: Specifies the tables from which to retrieve data.\n",
    "   - 2. **WHERE**: Filters the rows returned based on a condition.\n",
    "   - 3. **GROUP BY**: Groups rows that have the same values into summary rows.\n",
    "   - 4. **HAVING**: Filters groups based on a condition.\n",
    "   - 5. **SELECT**: Selects the columns to be retrieved.\n",
    "   - 6. **ORDER BY**: Sorts the result set in ascending or descending order.\n",
    "   - 7. **LIMIT**: Specifies a limit on the number of rows returned."

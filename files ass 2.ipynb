    "   - In Python, the `Exception` class serves as the base class for all built-in exceptions. When creating custom exceptions, it's essential to inherit from `Exception` to maintain compatibility with the existing exception handling mechanisms in Python. By inheriting from `Exception`, custom exceptions can be caught using `except Exception:` or more specific exception classes, allowing for better control and organization of error handling in your code.\n",

    "   - The `ArithmeticError` class in Python defines errors that occur during arithmetic operations. Two errors defined in this class are `ZeroDivisionError` and `OverflowError`.\n",
    "     - `ZeroDivisionError`: This error occurs when attempting to divide by zero.\n",

    "6. List down some best practices for exception handling in Python:\n",
    "   - Be specific: Catch only the exceptions you expect and can handle.\n",
    "   - Use multiple except blocks: Handle different exceptions differently.\n",
    "   - Keep exception handling concise: Avoid excessive nesting and keep the try block as short as possible.\n",
    "   - Provide helpful error messages: Include information in error messages that helps in debugging.\n",

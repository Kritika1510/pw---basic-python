    "   - Multiprocessing in Python refers to the ability of a program to create and run multiple processes concurrently. Each process runs independently and has its own memory space, allowing for true parallelism. Multiprocessing is useful for CPU-bound tasks where parallel execution can significantly improve performance by utilizing multiple CPU cores.\n",

    "Q1. \n",
    "   - MongoDB is a popular NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, JSON-like format known as BSON. It is a document-oriented database, which means it stores data in collections of JSON-like documents.\n",
    "   - Non-relational databases, or NoSQL databases, are databases that do not rely on the traditional tabular structures of relational databases. They offer flexibility in data storage and are designed to handle unstructured or semi-structured data.\n",
    "   - MongoDB is preferred over SQL databases in scenarios where:\n",
    "     - There is a need for flexible schema design, as MongoDB does not require a predefined schema.\n",
    "     - There are large volumes of data with a variety of data types, as MongoDB can handle unstructured data efficiently.\n",
    "     - Rapid development and scalability are required, as MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling and can easily accommodate growing data needs.\n",
    "     - There is a need for high availability and fault tolerance, as MongoDB supports replication and automatic failover.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. \n",
    "   - **Flexible Schema**: MongoDB does not require a predefined schema, allowing for dynamic and flexible data models.\n",
    "   - **Scalability**: MongoDB is horizontally scalable, meaning it can handle large volumes of data and traffic by distributing data across multiple servers.\n",
    "   - **High Availability**: MongoDB supports replica sets, ensuring data availability and fault tolerance in case of server failures.\n",
    "   - **Rich Query Language**: MongoDB provides a powerful query language with support for a wide range of query operations, including aggregation and geospatial queries.\n",
    "   - **Indexing**: MongoDB supports indexing to improve query performance by efficiently retrieving data.\n",
    "   - **GridFS**: MongoDB includes GridFS, a specification for storing and retrieving large files such as images, videos, and audio files.\n",
    "   - **Aggregation Framework**: MongoDB provides an aggregation framework for performing data aggregation operations, such as grouping, sorting, and filtering.\n",
    "   - **Geospatial Indexes**: MongoDB supports geospatial indexes and queries, allowing for location-based queries and analysis.\n",

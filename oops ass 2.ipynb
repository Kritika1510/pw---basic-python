    "Q1. Class and Object: In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint for creating objects (instances). It defines the attributes and methods that the objects of the class will have. An object is an instance of a class, which means it is a specific realization of that class. For example, consider a class `Car`, which may have attributes like `color`, `brand`, and methods like `drive()` and `stop()`. An object `my_car` created from this class would have specific values for its attributes, such as `color = 'red'` and `brand = 'Toyota'`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q2. Four Pillars of OOPs:\n",
    "   - Encapsulation: The bundling of data and methods that operate on the data into a single unit, i.e., a class. It helps in hiding the internal state of an object from the outside world and only exposing the necessary functionalities.\n",
    "   - Abstraction: The concept of hiding the complex implementation details and showing only the necessary features of an object. It allows focusing on what an object does instead of how it achieves it.\n",
    "   - Inheritance: The mechanism of creating a new class (derived class) from an existing class (base class) such that the derived class inherits the properties and behavior of the base class.\n",
    "   - Polymorphism: The ability of different objects to respond to the same message or method call in different ways. It allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q3. The `__init__()` function is used in Python to initialize the newly created object. It is called automatically when a new instance of the class is created. The primary purpose of `__init__()` is to set up the initial state of the object by initializing its attributes. Here's an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "class Car:\n",
    "    def __init__(self, color, brand):\n",
    "        self.color = color\n",
    "        self.brand = brand\n",
    "\n",
    "my_car = Car('red', 'Toyota')\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Q4. self` in OOPs: In Python, `self` is a reference to the current instance of the class. It is used to access variables and methods within the class. When defining methods in a class, the first parameter of the method is always `self`, which represents the instance on which the method is being called. It helps differentiate between instance variables and local variables within the class.\n",
    "\n",
    "Q5. Inheritance is a fundamental concept in OOP where a new class (derived class) is created by inheriting properties and behavior from an existing class (base class). This allows code reusability and establishes a hierarchical relationship between classes. There are different types of inheritance:\n",
    "   - Single Inheritance: When a class inherits from only one base class.\n",
    "     \n",
    "     class Animal:\n",
    "         def sound(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Animal makes a sound\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class Dog(Animal):\n",
    "         def bark(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Dog barks\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     \n",
    "   Multiple Inheritance: When a class inherits from more than one base class.\n",
    "    \n",
    "     class A:\n",
    "         def method_A(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Method A\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class B:\n",
    "         def method_B(self):\n",
    "             print(\"Method B\")\n",
    "\n",
    "     class C(A, B):\n",
    "         pass\n",
    "     \n",
    "   Multilevel Inheritance: When a derived class is created from another derived class.\n",
